## *摘要*
 - Numerical partial differential equations is the branch of numerical analysis that studies the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs).

## *介绍*
 - An electric potential (also called the electric field potential or the electrostatic potential) is the amount of electric potential energy that a unitary point electric charge would have if located at any point in space, and is equal to the work done by an external agent in carrying a unit of positive charge from the arbitrarily chosen reference point (usually infinity) to that point without any acceleration.
According to theoretical electromagnetics, electric potential is a scalar quantity denoted by V, equal to the electric potential energy of any charged particle at any location (measured in joules) divided by the charge of that particle (measured in coulombs). By dividing out the charge on the particle a remainder is obtained that is a property of the electric field itself.
In physics, a wave is an oscillation accompanied by a transfer of energy that travels through a medium (space or mass). Frequency refers to the addition of time. Wave motion transfers energy from one point to another, which displace particles of the transmission mediumCthat is, with little or no associated mass transport. Waves consist, instead, of oscillations or vibrations (of a physical quantity), around almost fixed locations.

 - There are two main types of waves. Mechanical waves propagate through a medium, and the substance of this medium is deformed. Restoring forces then reverse the deformation. For example, sound waves propagate via air molecules colliding with their neighbors. When the molecules collide, they also bounce away from each other (a restoring force). This keeps the molecules from continuing to travel in the direction of the wave.

## *结论*
 - 生涩的完成了作业，还是有很多不懂，需要通过练习加强。
 - 需要和大神多多交流长知识。
 - Use computer to simulate the wave motion can help us understand the theory better.


## *致谢*
  - 非常感谢老师一个学期的悉心教导，老师辛苦了。
  - 俺由衷的感谢物基二班的肖峰，杜琛，杜威，杨宗蒙，仲逸飞，李金庭，李春兴以及江俊同学，在很多不熟悉不懂的地方借鉴和模仿了很多他们的内容，让我以磕磕绊绊的完成了自己的作业。望自己再接再厉，以后可以好好使用计算物理。
